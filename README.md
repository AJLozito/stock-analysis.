The VBA Stock Challenge (Let’s Help Steven’s Parents Get Invested)


Overview

     The purpose of this project was to help Steven recommend stocks to his parents. They initially bought a company with the ticker “DQ” because it reminded them of their first date, but Steven wanted to analyze other stocks to make sure they received the best return on their investment. In order to solve this problem, we put together a VBA script that evaluated the returns of several stocks in order to provide the optimal recommendation. We accomplished this by writing multiple pieces of code to assess the annual returns of several stocks and highlighting the best performing stocks in green, while leaving the laggards in red. 


Results

     After calculating the results, we could clearly tell that only two stocks had a positive performance in both 2017 and 2018 (ENPH and RUN). Of those two, ENPH was the best performer with a return of over 80% in both years.
     The execution time was slightly better in the refactored code, as 2017 ran in 1.113 seconds, and 2018 ran in 1.089 seconds.
     
     
Summary

     The advantages of refactored code are that most of the code is already written, so you may only have to modify a few pieces in order for it to work. This allows you spend less time writing code and more time evaluating stocks. Also, you have a proven piece of code that has worked to solve another problem. The disadvantages are that any code you find may not have been intended to solve the same type of problem, so you may spend more time modifying it than you would have spent writing new code. Also, the other person may not have left instructions, so you’d spend time explain what every piece of code does.
